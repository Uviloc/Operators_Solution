[HIGHEST] Scenes stop in xpression if xpressionImage to bitmap is used too much


[HIGH] When switching scenes in xpression, the program XPression window freezes and fails
[HIGH] When having multiple buttons, the clip index is still set high for the new button press



[LOW] If button is pressed while scene could not be found (due to missing reference/wrong graphics software settings) the clip index still advances.
	Could be good for a missing clip, but not maybe still fix to some extend
[LOW] ClipPath still changes previous items when they were statetrack and new one is set to statetrack
