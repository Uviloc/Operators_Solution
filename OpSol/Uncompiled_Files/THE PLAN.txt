Send feedback form at same time as report


Elsa:
Where is the xPression dongel case

____________________________________________________________________Feedback:________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------ Week 20: -----------


------------ Week 19: -----------
Questions:
I will not be able to finish the project. Plan of action.
Estemated time of completion: 2 weeks until feature-complete + 2 weeks until full release + 2 weeks until complete = 2 months with current speed

Options:
- Abandon project for now (Very sad about it, but likely scenario)
- Somebody else continues with the code
- Suggest as side job to Michael (likely 8-16 hour workweeks so 8/9 months)

What should I work on now?
> Report + presentation
> Clean up code
> Explain code to Hylke (Plan this)
> Some sort of test/viewing with operators (those who want to)
- Documentation (Tutorial document)
- Continue coding


When do you want the code on Allus GitHub


Final evaluation sheet (same as last (I can send))
When final report is done review it

Deadline Report: 19-Jan
Deadline Presentation: 24-Jan

Overall Feedback:
Wasn't surprised that the application is unfinished.
I went really deep into coding and creating this application.
There would be potential for a new employee but not as a full-time programmer. There likely needs to be more then just programming for it to be viable to hire me.

Questions & Answers:
WIP		>	Plan of action for after unfinished product: Discussion with Michael will take place to see if there is any potential for a future job.
WIP		>	What should I work on now?: Report, cleaning of code and making it ready to show to Hylke
WIP		>	Final evaluation sheet: Will be filled in next week
WIP		>	Do you want the code on your GitHub: Yes will be done next week


------------ Week 16: -----------
Overall Feedback:
In regards to databases. Dont make it complicated, just make it so that the user can add a database with predetermined tables and columns.
Adding rows to the database would be a concern if the table is very long as this would take time to get to the bottom.
A search function would be best, idealy with some input redundancy to also check names with some character difference.
Would be cool to have a procedural form to edit the databases. Rejected by me.
Have the fields in the database be correct for the type of data, So int would be like a domainupdown menu, or countries a list with options from another database (Use suggestAppend for the combobox)
Overall very happy and commented on how I am making the best use of the internship out of anybody.
Now focus on what is really needed.

Questions & Answers:
WIP		>	How do I get the CasparCG project to run: will sit down for that at some point
DONE	>	Are there any planned games where I can test the program in January: no but we will stress test it with some people in week 3 of January
DONE	>	How can I get the live game up with preview: Not needed
WIP		>	Send Ross mail about xpTools having high memory and breaking the live view: Login information will be send for contacting Ross. if not through community, they can maybe go through with calling
DONE	>	What is the distrubution of which graphics program is used for all current projects: New ones all use xPression, some still use CasparCG and none use vMix atm, many are however from existing things with existing interfaces
DONE	>	What is usually the go to program used for new projects: xPression
DONE	>	!!!!!! Either the same naming and pathing conventions need to be used between Caspar files and xPression scenes, or they need to be set seperately in the form dll: 2nd option
DONE	>	Pictures for presentation/report: in server


------------ Week 11: -----------
Overall Feedback:
Very nicely orginised documents and planning.
All in all good progress and ideas, very interesting to make the program modular and have each graphics program be possible
Try to keep on track for what is required.

Questions & Answers:
DONE	>	Is displaying the thumbnail of the scene good enough as a preview: already fixed before discussion
DONE	>	How can I get the live game up with preview: -
DONE	>	Should the program still be in visual studio so editing is possible???? Like have a library dll file that enables these functions:
				depends on what is easiest. doesnt matter if robust
DONE	>	Am I allowed to just copy the dll of xpression into my project so they dont need to be loaded in with code: yes they are public
DONE	>	Can I get the CasparCG project for Enfusion: on server under graphics folder
DONE	>	Scott wanted icon for twitter to be for x in Enfusion: made in flash so no


------------ Week 8: -----------
Overall Feedback:
Huge plans but with lots of promise.
Very orginised workflow and well documented code.
Player pictures should be loaded dynamicly by the program. With a folder path to outside the program (check with Hylke if also good if picture is just in the database?)
Firday Thomas will be here using XPression to make handball graphics packet
Next week (Week 5) 2 days will be spend setting up the graphics packet into the software from Hylke

Questions & Answers:
DONE	>	GitHub eventually put it in the main repository but fine for now
DONE	>	Dynamic reference loading: Great stuff
DONE	>	Preview maybe not possible with XPression?: Check if preview marker can be accessed, otherwise check if preview channel can be setup as a temporary
DONE	>	Settings: Setup what preview channel is used, setup what output channel is used
DONE	>	When meeting with operator?: somewhere next week or maybe after
DONE	>	Mid-term evaluation form: send it.
DONE	>	Do you ever want a button that can play clips in different scenes: Possibly in the future
DONE	>	xml editor: libreoffice & db browser

DONE	>	Does each sport get one database or does it need to be split up further?: each sport one, then further into national etc
WIP		>	Can the player pictures also be in the database instead of a folder reference, or would this not be ideal?: if you make it nice, yes
DONE	>	Can I get a vMix project code, to see its functions and how they differ: not a recent working one


------------ Week 6/7: -----------
Overall Feedback:
Focus on learning the existing code and the libraries for now
> Go to Enfusion on Sat 2 Nov
> Go to Handball on Thu 7 Nov (plan 2 days to work on the code for this)

Questions & Answers:
DONE	>	GitHub will be checked
DONE	>	Will setup a meeting with one of the operators to check what they want
DONE	>	Make functions so that the graphics program can be interchanged
DONE	>	Make the design of the program better (better menu on the left side, maybe check other programs)
WIP		>	set all other buttons offline when clicking on any button to online
DONE	>	Make the process of adding a button easier then the current
DONE	>	Contact Roy to setup a visit from Herman
DONE	>	Office is not used (another xml software is used) 
WIP		>	Excel as import

> Check how best to implement a new button. Such as one button with multiple possible types or adding custom buttons

______________________________________________________________Questions for Operator:________________________________________________________________________________________
- What is your typical work setup while operating (monitors, open programs, audio, input devices)
> One output screen with the live view, 1 screen laptop or monitor with the buttons, one multiview screen (xpression is in background)

- What would you want in terms of preventing AND correcting wrong button presses
>

- Do you ever need to adjust the timer midway through a match
> Yes, especially matches that stop regularly

- What features would you like to see in an ideal scenario
>

- Is there any information you want to see while working in the program
	(this can include things like the current time, a live view of the broadcast, clip information, game status?, etc)
>

- Do you have XPression or another tool open on the side and what do you use it for > could this be implemented in the program
> 

- Do you see any use for keyboard shortcuts to trigger certain scenes, or do other actions
> Yes but if a program uses keyboard shortcuts, everything should be on keyboard

- Would you like to have the window size change? if so, does it also need to scale the aspect ratio
>

- Are there any button presses where you want to have a confirmation to be prompted
>

- If there is an error (like a scene not found etc) in what way do you want to know about this. (popup, message somewhere on screen)
>

- While an animation is playing, do you ever need to interupt this/start playing a different scene.
	How do you want this action to be handled: have the new scene be added in a queue or just interupt the previous scene
>

- (Did things ever go wrong for you and how did you respond to it.)
>

Do you mostly want to have one program on screen

good indication for paused timer or displayed graphics:
blinking, coloured border

How much would a preview window change?



_______________________________________________________________Possible Additions:___________________________________________________________________________________________
- LoadProject > having the XPression project open up when the application also opens.
	(Have a seperate app for each show, or have all together but have tabs that open the project or have a button to open project)
- Add indicator of event playing (like a progress fill bar across the button) for duration of scene. (Have button not able to be pressed?)

_____________________________________________________________________Tasks:__________________________________________________________________________________________________
XPression.net.dll seems to have moved in newer versions: nope it was always there, but the location isnt fixed so better as it is

Icons:
	for switch button: vertical rectangel with one half filled in


------------ Current: -----------
> Add on/off property to the buttons with 2 states. This then influences what action to take (show/hide)


> Work out how to manage variables.
	clip index		> should be per button (and maybe reset when another button is pressed)
	scene object changes	> seperate connector component (benifits with having a different interface and showing its a general component)
	scenes			> (now they keep creating a new scene, reseting the object changes and creating new ones constantly)
> Put operator questions into google form so answers are nicely logged?
> Maybe not reset all buttons when clicking on a different one, but have different functions for this?

> Setup for scenedirectortrack getclips

> In clipcollection class: scene director + track
> Copy over track (dynamicly set track and scenedirector with xpression.net functions)


------------ Research: -----------
> set online/offline/preview
> try again to set the click event function automaticly?
> controls to examine: Timers, radio buttons, menu bar, checkboxes, combobox, visual output for preview?, xml interface and dropoff point, treeview
> Research on other aids outside of example: preview image (when hovering over button), 
> Research on data input, Excel/SQLite (how to import into program, how to save to database, how to edit in program)
> How to add robustness to wrong names (make function that check how wrong the words are and set all to lowercase)??
> Add duplicate, copy, paste buttons to clipCollection?
> Add a name to the items in clipCollection



------------ Design: -----------
> Design overall program visuals and functions
> Create a basic prototype or visual aid
> Optimise most important code needed for connection between SQLite/Excel, C# and XPression
> Create multitude of custom tools and properties required for common workflow


------------ Test: -----------
> Test basic version of this with Hylke and/or Operator
> Implement feedback
> Check memory, performance etc, stress test
> 
> Make a tutorial document that outlines the steps to follow for anybody to create a new packet
	like making use of standerdised names where needed

______________________________________________________________Design Requirements:____________________________________________________________________________________________
- converts all data from file format into the code and can display this to XPression
- Code is all compacted into simple to make functions, so that non programmers can setup a new packet in 1-2 hours
- Fully robust code with no errors
- Any spelling errors are addressed immidiatly and will not show up only when its button is pressed
- Good user interface that can be understood instantly by any semi-professional
- Redundancy in terms of being able to go back if a mistake is made (like advancing a fight too early)

______________________________________________________________________Plan:___________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------ Connections: -----------
Excel document/SQLite .db file		>		Match data, player data, image files
Program					>		Takes in data from document and puts this in program
Program					>		Handles all button presses and sends data to XPression
XPression				>		Executes scenes


------------ Workflow: -----------
Steps:	Task:
1	Create new form with wanted buttons
2	Choose what type of button type in proporties (on/off state, multistep button, etc)
3	Assign scenes, actions, or any other functionality to the buttons in proporties
4	Create datasheet (using a template) with the following data:
		General Information on the sport/sponsers/etc, Matches, players with attached information including photo
5	Test program




------------ Project structure: -----------
Main application > exe file
Reference folder:
	dll file with custom controls
	dll file with custom functions

	(optional) dll file with XPression functions
	(optional) dll file with vMix functions
	(optional) dll file with CasparCG functions

	(optional) dll file of Enfusion package (form only)



changes:
possible graphics programs checked in main app, then put into as a possible function


Problems with modular:
1. If a graphics program needs different values like scene director, clip, etc. > solution: have the collection be able to be overridden and added to by different dll

_______________________________________________________________Realistic Controls:____________________________________________________________________________________________
------------ Functions: -----------
Lock another control with normal checkbox but common function?
Hide other buttons before showing same layer (only with different scene and same layer) > getOnline, the ones that are online can be on others are off


------------ Controls: -----------
- Show/Hide button (Set others in same group to hide first?) (clearIn, clearOut) (if show/hide is in button text, change this)
- script button, a button that takes in a list of scenes(/clips) to play out in order whenever button is pressed
	(This is essentially the current operator button except not playing multiple scenes and needs to be able to be edited in program)
- Logic button, a button that takes in clips to play and is able to generate multiple buttons within itself that play out parts of the scene based on what clip is displayed
	Also takes in what data it needs, and if its missing will not show up
	Have timer variable for each clip (or based on clip length)

- Timer module, connects to a widget (but can work independently), can have timeout button, etc.
- Score module, a panel with buttons to keep score, connects to widget (but can work independently)
- Material accessor: a color field that is the color of the material and if clicked on can change the color in xpression


All buttons should have a variable list property: it takes in a material/object/WIDGET and changes it to be something else.
	This should also be able to reference a datasheet/container/input field (for countdown/suspended)?


------------ Left from EHF: -----------
Load team in panel from dropdown field
Suspend player

API
Database >
	Have a function to hide certain players in a team when showing the team in the matchup


------------ Left from Enfusion/8TKO: -----------
-Match list (next/previous player in list etc)
